# Changelog

## 0.4.4 (2017-02-13)

* Feature: Add request header accessors (Ã  la PSR-7)
  (#103 by @clue)

  ```php
  // get value of host header
  $host = $request->getHeaderLine('Host');

  // get list of all cookie headers
  $cookies = $request->getHeader('Cookie');
  ```

* Feature: Forward `pause()` and `resume()` from `Request` to underlying connection
  (#110 by @clue)

  ```php
  // support back-pressure when piping request into slower destination
  $request->pipe($dest);

  // manually pause/resume request
  $request->pause();
  $request->resume();
  ```

* Fix: Fix `100-continue` to be handled case-insensitive and ignore it for HTTP/1.0.
  Similarly, outgoing response headers are now handled case-insensitive, e.g
  we no longer apply chunked transfer encoding with mixed-case `Content-Length`.
  (#107 by @clue)
  
  ```php
  // now handled case-insensitive
  $request->expectsContinue();

  // now works just like properly-cased header
  $response->writeHead($status, array('content-length' => 0));
  ```

* Fix: Do not emit empty `data` events and ignore empty writes in order to
  not mess up chunked transfer encoding
